                <h3>The Manufacturing Process</h3>

                A Rolex watch takes about a year to make, with nearly everything created in-house at one of the
                company’s 4 state-of-the-art manufacture locations in Switzerland. Each component of a single watch goes
                through a rigorous testing process to make sure they do not leave factory unless they are perfect.

                <h3>The Movement</h3>

                Each Rolex movement is made up of hundreds of carefully manufactured components, coming together to form
                something which guarantees long-term high performance. After undergoing an intricate “exacting” process,
                the Rolex movement becomes a certified Swiss chronometer.

                <h3>The Date Magnification</h3>

                All Rolex Watches with a date function, apart from the Seadweller models, feature a bubble
                magnification, called the Cyclops. Positioned over the date display of the watch, the Cyclops magnifies
                the aperture at a magnification of 2.5 times. You won’t find this particular magnification on any other
                watch; most Rolex imitations with only magnify 1.5 times.

                <h3>The Stainless Steel</h3>

                You may or may not know that stainless steel comes in various grades and types. Most watches are made
                from a type called 316L, but Rolex uses 904L – a type of steel that, as far as we know, no one else
                uses.

                <h3>The Oyster Case</h3>

                Rolex’s unique watch case, the Oyster case, boasts excellence in both form and function, and promises to
                be robust and waterproof whether constructed in steel, gold or platinum. The Oyster case was invented in
                1926 and was the world’s first waterproof case for a wristwatch.

                <h3>The Watch Case Back</h3>

                The back of a Rolex watch case is smooth, rather than engraved with designs or logos, although the
                inside is engraved with a model number. The only exceptions for this are the Rolex Sea Dweller, Milgauss
                case backs, and any Rolex ladies watches produced before 1990.

                <h3>The Triplock Crown Seal</h3>

                Some of the Rolex sports watches including the Sea-Dweller, Submariner and Daytona watches feature
                something called the Triplock winding crown seal. This is an extra seal in the threads of the winding
                crown’s tube, and can be viewed when the winding crown is unscrewed.
