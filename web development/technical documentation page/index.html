                <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language. Python programming
                    language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along
                    with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.

                    Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like :– <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Google</li>
                    <li>Amazon </li>
                    <li>Facebook</li>
                    <li>Instagram</li>
                    <li>Dropbox</li>
                    <li>Uber… etc.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language, which allows
                    programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms. Python programs generally are smaller than
                    other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and the indentation
                    requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.</p>

                    In Python, input is the process of getting data from the user. This data can be anything from a
                    simple string to a complex object. The most common way to get input from the user is to use the
                    input() function. The input() function takes a prompt as its argument, which is a string that is
                    displayed to the user before they enter their input. The user's input is then returned as a string.
                    For example, the following code will ask the user for their name and then print it back to them:

                    <code>
                    name = input("What is your name? ")
                    print("Your name is", name)</code>
                </p>

                <p>

                    Output in Python is the process of displaying data to the user. This data can be anything from a
                    simple string to a complex object. The most common way to output data to the user is to use the
                    print() function. The print() function takes any number of arguments, which are the data that you
                    want to display. The print() function will then display the data to the user, one item per line.

                    For example, the following code will print the numbers 1 to 10:

                    <code>
                    for i in range(1, 11):
                    print(i)</code>

                    Operators in Python are special symbols that are used to perform operations on variables and values.
                    There are many different types of operators in Python, but some of the most common include:

                    Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction,
                    multiplication, division, and modulus. For example, the expression 5 + 2 will return the value 7,
                    because 5 added to 2 is 7.
                    Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value (True or False). For
                    example, the expression 5 == 2 will return False, because 5 is not equal to 2.
                    Logical operators are used to combine Boolean values and return a new Boolean value. For example,
                    the expression 5 > 2 and 3 < 4 will return True, because 5 is greater than 2 and 3 is less than 4.
                        Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. For example, the expression x=5
                        will assign the value 5 to the variable x. Identity operators are used to compare the identity
                        of two objects. For example, the expression x is y will return True if x and y are the same
                        object, and False otherwise. Membership operators are used to check if a value is a member of a
                        sequence. For example, the expression 'a' in 'abc' will return True, because the character 'a'
                        is a member of the string 'abc' .</p>
                        <p>Here is a table of all the operators in Python:

                            Comparison operators ==, !=, <,>, <=,>=
                                    Logical operators and, or, not
                                    Assignment operators =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=
                                    Identity operators is, is not
                                    Membership operators in, not in

                    Data types in Python are used to define the type of data that a variable can store. There are many
                    different data types in Python, but some of the most common include:

                    Numeric data types are used to store numbers. The most common numeric data types are int, float, and
                    complex.
                    String data types are used to store text. Strings are enclosed in quotes.
                    Sequence data types are used to store collections of data. The most common sequence data types are
                    list, tuple, and range.
                    Mapping data types are used to store data in key-value pairs. The most common mapping data type is
                    dict.
                    Boolean data types are used to store true or false values. The only two possible values for a
                    Boolean data type are True and False.</p>
                <p>Here is a table of all the data types in Python:

                    Data type Description
                    int Used to store integers
                    float Used to store floating-point numbers
                    complex Used to store complex numbers
                    str Used to store strings
                    list Used to store lists of data
                    tuple Used to store tuples of data
                    range Used to store a range of numbers
                    dict Used to store mappings of keys to values
                    bool Used to store Boolean values

                <p>
                    Control flow in Python is the order in which the statements in a program are executed. It is
                    regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls.

                    Conditional statements are used to make decisions about the flow of execution. The most common
                    conditional statement in Python is the if statement. The if statement evaluates a condition and, if
                    the condition is true, executes a block of code. If the condition is false, the block of code is
                    skipped.
                    <code>
                    x = 5
                    if x < 10: print("x is less than 10") else: print("x is not less than 10") 
                </code>
                    Learn more Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times or until a certain
                    condition is met. The most common loops in Python are the while loop and the for loop. The while
                    loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true. The for loop repeats a block of
                    code for each item in a sequence. 
                    <code> # While loop x=0 while x < 10: print(x) x +=1 # For
                        loop numbers=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for number in numbers: print(number) </code>

                    more Function calls are used to execute a block of code that has been defined previously.
                    Functions can be used to encapsulate code that is used frequently or to make code more modular.
                    <code>def factorial(n): if n==0: return 1 else: return n * factorial(n - 1)
                        print(factorial(5))</code>
